Project overview (tl;dr)
NullAudit converts code / contracts / agent artifacts into deterministic, auditable security reports using:
deterministic static tools (Semgrep, Slither),


a multi-LLM ensemble (cloud + on-prem + specialized) via the MCP (Model & Capability Provider) framework, and


a Security & Evaluation Agent (SEA) that builds canonical findings, computes a normalized SecurityScore (0–100), produces a Merkleized AuditBundle, and anchors attestations on XAVA L1 (or other supported chains).


Outputs:
Human readable report, machine JSON (AuditBundle), and an on-chain Attestation (attestationId) used for launch gating (canGraduate) and settlement.


Goals: reproducibility, tamper evidence, multi-model triangulation, governance-adjustable thresholds.

Quickstart — run locally
This quickstart sets up a minimal local environment for experimentation: a simple orchestrator, a local mock MCP provider, Semgrep scans, and a simulated AttestationAnchor (local dev Ethereum node).
Requirements
Node.js >= 18, npm/yarn


Python 3.10+ (for some scanner wrappers)


Docker & docker-compose


Hardhat or Ganache for local EVM dev (we use Hardhat in examples)


Clone & install
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/nullaudit.git
cd nullaudit
# Install orchestrator / workers
cd services/orchestrator && npm install
cd ../sea && npm install
cd ../mcp-mock && npm install

ENV (example .env.local)
# orchestrator
ORCH_HOST=0.0.0.0
ORCH_PORT=4000
XAVA_RPC=http://localhost:8545
ATTESTATION_CONTRACT=0xAaAa...  # deployed local contract
SEA_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc...
MCP_REGISTRY_URL=http://localhost:5001/registry
CACHE_DIR=./cache

Start local chain (Hardhat)
# from project root
docker-compose -f dev/docker-compose.yml up --build
# (or run `npx hardhat node` in evm node directory)

Deploy local AttestationAnchor (sample Hardhat task)
cd contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-attestation-anchor.js --network localhost
# output: AttestationAnchor at 0x...

Run services
# from services/
# start mock MCP provider
cd mcp-mock && npm run start

# start SEA (scanner + aggregator)
cd ../sea && npm run dev

# start orchestrator API
cd ../orchestrator && npm run dev

Run a sample audit (curl)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/audit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "repo_url":"https://github.com/example/vulnerable-contract",
    "commit":"main",
    "entry":"contracts/MyToken.sol",
    "options": {"deepScan": false}
  }'

Expected result: orchestrator returns job id, you can GET /api/v1/audit/:id to stream progress and final AuditBundle CID + attestationRef after anchor.

Core components & responsibilities
Orchestrator / Supervisor
Accepts audit jobs, manages sessions, composes InvocationEnvelopes, manages capability tokens, tracks job progress, and collects responses.


Responsibilities:


Job queue (Redis / BullMQ)


Parallel provider invocations


Provenance bundling


Compute receipts forwarding to FeeDistributor


Persistence to off-chain storage (IPFS / S3)


Expose HTTP/GraphQL API and SDK


Security & Evaluation Agent (SEA)
Runs deterministic scanners, aggregates model outputs, constructs consensus, computes SecurityScore, builds AuditBundle, signs attestation payloads, and calls AttestationAnchor.


Subcomponents:


Scanner layer (Semgrep, Slither, fuzzing orchestrator)


Ensemble adapter (MCP client)


Consensus & correlation engine (fingerprinting, grouping, weighted aggregation)


Scoring engine (CS → EW → Exposure → S)


Attestor: Merkle tree builder + signer keyset / BLS aggregated signature manager


MCP Framework
Provider Registry (on-chain minimal + off-chain descriptor store)


Tool Descriptor (TD) spec (prompt templates, schemas, cost model)


Invocation & Response envelope schemas (EIP-712 style)


Cache & replay layer for deterministic prompts


Tool Registry & Scanner Agents
Semgrep ruleset packages, scanner configuration, dynamic test harnesses


Rule versioning & provenance metadata


Storage & Event/Mem Fabric
IPFS/Arweave for AuditBundles


Vector DB (e.g., Milvus, Pinecone) for semantic retrieval (RAG)


Event log (append-only) with periodic Merkle anchors on XAVA L1


On-chain primitives
AttestationAnchor — stores Merkle roots and signer signatures


Registry — provider & tool listings


SettlementRouter — posts settlementIntents and finalizes with relayerProofs


CommitmentVault (for launches) — holds collateral & conviction logic

}

Full JSON Schema files live under /schemas/ in the repo (invocation.schema.json, response.schema.json, audit.schema.json).

Protocol flows (audit, attestation, graduation)
1) Audit run (detailed steps)
User submits job → Orchestrator assigns jobId.


Orchestrator runs deterministic scanners; produce evidence_refs.


Compose InvocationEnvelope per provider + sign; conduct parallel calls.


Collect ResponseEnvelopes; verify provider signatures and schema.


Group & correlate findings (fingerprint + LSH fuzzy grouping).


Compute CS and S as per scoring pipeline.


Persist AuditBundle to IPFS; compute Merkle root over canonical finding payloads.


SEA signs AttestationPayload; call AttestationAnchor.anchor.


Return reportURL, bundleCID, attestationId to user.


2) Graduating a launch (canary → omnichain)
LaunchContract requires attestationId to proceed to graduate().


canGraduate(attestationId) calls SecurityOracle.getScore(attestationId) or reads on-chain attestation metadata.


If S >= S_min and anchor_fresh & signer_quorum satisfied → graduate() proceeds; otherwise blocked.


Upon graduation, SettlementRouter posts settlement intents for bridging; relayers verify attestation before minting wTOKEN.

CLI & SDK examples
Node.js SDK (example)
import { NullAuditClient } from "@nullaudit/sdk";

const client = new NullAuditClient({ baseUrl: process.env.ORCH_URL, apiKey: process.env.NA_API_KEY });

const job = await client.createAudit({
  repo: "https://github.com/example/vulnerable-contract",
  entry: "contracts/MyToken.sol",
  deepScan: true
});

console.log("Job ID:", job.id);

const res = await client.waitForJob(job.id, { timeout: 600000 });
console.log("Audit complete:", res.reportUrl, res.attestationId);

CLI (example)
# using curl
curl -X POST $ORCH_URL/api/v1/audit -H 'Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY' \
  -d '{"repo":"https://github.com/foo/bar","entry":"contracts/X.sol","options":{"deepScan":true}}'

SDK (TypeScript) and Python client live in /sdk/js and /sdk/py.

Deployment (Docker, k8s) & environment
Microservices layout
orchestrator (Node.js, Express) — REST/GraphQL API, job queue.


sea (Node.js/Python) — scanner orchestrator, consensus engine.


mcp-proxy (Node.js) — orchestrates calls to external LLM providers.


mcp-mock — local test provider (for CI).


storage — IPFS node or S3-compatible service.


db — Postgres for job meta, Redis for queue.


vector-db — Milvus or Pinecone for RAG indexing.


Docker Compose (dev)
dev/docker-compose.yml includes services for db, redis, ipfs, orchestrator, sea, mcp-mock, hardhat.
Kubernetes (production) recommendations
Each service deployed as separate Deployment + HPA


Use PersistentVolumes for cache/keys


Secrets via K8s secrets or HashiCorp Vault


Service mesh (optional) for telemetry and mTLS


Use CronJob for periodic anchoring & registry snapshots


Environment variables (partial)
# Orchestrator

CI / GitHub Actions example (audit as pre-merge gate)
Add workflow: .github/workflows/audit.yml to block PRs that fail NullAudit.
name: NullAudit premerge
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run static checks
        run: npm ci && npm run lint
      - name: Submit to NullAudit (local or hosted)
        run: |
          JOB=$(curl -X POST http://nullaudit.local/api/v1/audit -H "Authorization: Bearer $NA_KEY" \
            -d '{"repo":"'$GITHUB_SERVER_URL'/'$GITHUB_REPOSITORY'","commit":"'$GITHUB_SHA'","entry":"contracts/*.sol"}')
          echo "Job: $JOB"
      - name: Wait for audit
        run: |
          # poll the orchestrator for job status...
          # if SecurityScore < threshold -> fail

This allows CI to block merges until SecurityScore >= threshold.

Testing & adversarial scenarios
Testing is essential. Include unit tests, integration tests, and adversarial scenarios.
Unit tests
Validate schema parsers (invocation / response / bundle)


Test consensus aggregation math with synthetic models


Mock provider signature verification


Integration tests
Run local Hardhat chain; deploy AttestationAnchor and SettlementRouter.


Start mcp-mock and sea integration; run a full audit end-to-end and assert anchorId created and canGraduate semantics as expected.


Adversarial tests (recommended)
Prompt injection: craft LLM inputs containing malicious instructions; assert SEA reduces weight of uncorroborated model outputs and flags.


Provider compromise: mock a provider that returns fabricated ResponseEnvelopes (with invalid evidence_refs); ensure signature verification & registry bonding prevent acceptance for high-severity actions.


Replay / tampering: mutate AuditBundle off-chain and verify merkle proof fails.


DOS / cost attack: script large numbers of audit requests; assert rate limits & quota enforcement.


Relayer fraud simulation: simulate incorrect relayer proof and assert SettlementRouter handles challenge & slashing correctly.


Example test harness tests/integration/test_audit_flow.js uses mocha + chai.

Monitoring, metrics, and SLAs
Key metrics to expose:
audit.job.latency.p50/p95 (seconds)


audit.cost.avg (XAVA)


model.disagreement.rate (fraction of findings with > X variance)


scanner.coverage (percentage of rules executed)


attestation.anchor.latency (time between audit completion and anchor TX)


relayer.finalization.latency


Use Prometheus + Grafana:
Instrument Orchestrator and SEA with Prometheus metrics.


Alerts:


audit.latency.p95 > 10m → page ops


model.disagreement > 0.4 → model roster review


attestation.fail_rate > 0.01 → inspect signer keys


SLAs:
Quick scan: p50 < 30s, p95 < 60s


Standard scan: p50 3–6min, p95 10–15min


Attestation finalization: anchor TX inclusion within 1–5min (depending on chain)



Security considerations & operational best practices
Key management: Use threshold signing (BLS / Gnosis Safe) for SEA signers; rotate keys regularly and publish rotations.


Provider registry bonding: require economic bonds for high-risk providers; implement slashing when misbehavior detected.


Immutable evidence: push scanner outputs & provider transcripts to IPFS to ensure immutability; anchor Merkle roots frequently.


Privacy modes: support encrypted AuditBundles where only merkle root is public and payload requires authorized decryption.


Least privilege: capability tokens must be scoped and time-bound for side effects (on-chain writes, minting).


Monitoring & canarying: roll out new provider integrations or consensus threshold changes gradually using canary deployments and a small test corpus.


Mitigate DOS: rate limiting, CAPTCHAs on UI, and quotas for compute.



Governance, parameters & on-chain interactions
Key governance variables (should be adjustable via DAO):
S_min (SecurityScore threshold for graduation): default 85


alpha (evidence weight per scanner hit): default 0.10


H_cap (max scanner hit boost): default 5


relayer_bond_min: default 100,000 XAVA


attestation_challenge_window: default 12–72 hours depending on cross-chain finality


anchoring_cadence: default hourly


On-chain interactions:
AttestationAnchor receives anchor events.


Registry publishes provider information and tool descriptors (hash only on chain; content addressed off-chain).


SettlementRouter consumes attestationRef to validate before minting wrapped tokens or finalizing bridging.

Appendix — useful snippets
Compute / scoring pseudocode
def compute_S(models, scanner_hits, exposure, alpha=0.1, H_cap=5):
    # models: list of tuples (confidence, weight)
    W_sum = sum(w for _, w in models)
    ac_sum = sum(conf * w for conf, w in models)
    CS = ac_sum / W_sum if W_sum > 0 else 0.0
    EW = 1.0 + alpha * min(scanner_hits, H_cap)
    raw = CS * EW * exposure
    S = round(100 * min(raw, 1.0))
    return S

Verify attestation (python)
def verify_attestation(attestation_record, payload_hash, merkle_proof, signer_keys):
    # 1. check timestamp freshness
    if time.time() - attestation_record['auditTimestamp'] > T_FRESH:
        return False
    # 2. verify aggregator signature (BLS/multisig)
    if not verify_aggregated_attestor_sig(attestation_record['aggregatedSig'], attestation_record['merkleRoot'], signer_keys):
        return False
    # 3. verify merkle proof
    if not verify_merkle_proof(payload_hash, merkle_proof, attestation_record['merkleRoot']):
        return False
    return True


If you’d like I can:
Generate a ready-to-paste docker-compose.dev.yml and Kubernetes manifests (Helm charts) for production & staging,


Produce a full ADR and versioned parameter proposal for governance, or


Implement a sample AuditBundle verifier script (Node.js / Python) that fetches the IPFS bundle and validates merkle proofs + signatures end-to-end.


Which one do you want next?
